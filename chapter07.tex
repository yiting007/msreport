\chapter{Conclusion}
Compare with the criteria we proposed previously, this application fulfills all of our standards as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Representation Dimension
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Provide a visual representation for source and target ontologies
		\item Focus on a small part of the ontologies but also able to show the overview.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Analysis and Decision Making
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Provide ambiguous mappings for users, the system will detect the most ambiguous alinements made by different algorithm and show them to users.
		\item Let users internally make mapping decisions and mark the decisions that users already made.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Interaction Dimension
	\begin{itemize}
	 	\item User-driven navigation of concepts and properties.
		\item Searching for a specific concept and the abilities to go back and forward.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Additionally, nice interface of JavaFX also provides good user experience. However, there still remains much potential of improvement.
