\section*{Abstract}
In this project, we integrated AgreementMaker \cite{AgreementMaker} with JavaFX seamlessly and developed a way to visualize matching results of ontology with large size. We provide both general and detailed view of matching results to users. User is able to navigate through different ontology levels, search and see the structure of the source and target ontology pairs. This project also involves the issue of user intervention instead of only focusing on matching algorithms to compute candidate mappings, we provide user feedback loop with property clustering to help user makes decisions.\\[2cm]
