\section*{Abstract}
In this project, we added to the award winner ontology matching system AgreementMaker the capability to visualize the results of matching large ontologies. We provide a detailed view of the matching results to the users and allow them to navigate through different ontology levels, search, so as to traverse the structure of the source and target ontologies. This project also addresses the issue of user intervention when using a feedback loop strategy instead of focusing on matching algorithms that compute automatically candidate mappings.  We predict that capabilities that are offered to users will empower them to make decisions on the correctness of mappings by displaying property clustering. Our approach was implemented using JavaFX and integrates seamlessly with the current implementation of AgreementMaker. \\[2cm]
