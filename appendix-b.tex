\section{Main functions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Load data files that generated by AgreementMaker.
\item Display visualization for multiple algorithms, divide the screen into N parts, each of which represent a matching result for one algorithm.
\item Generate a list of ambiguous concepts/properties and their alignments, once user runs the user feedback loop, iterate that list and let user decide which one to match.
\item One to many matching aliments are provides, it means that user is able to choose from multiple concepts that could be matched to the given one. Matching is represented by percentage.
\item Assign the new matching confidence selected by user to the ontology matrix and send data back to AgreementMaker.
\end{itemize}
